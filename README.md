## Ceramic Tiles Quality Inspection System(OpenCV Python)
![Ceramic Tiles Quality Inspection  - Trim](https://github.com/Adeen317/Ceramic_Quality_Inspection/assets/112985225/ee965c34-8469-4329-90e2-add041347d78)
This repository contains the implementation of a defect detection system for tiles using OpenCV in Python. The system employs the template matching algorithm and contours to identify and highlight defects in tile surfaces.

### Overview
The system utilizes OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, to perform defect detection on tile images. The main components of the system include:

Template Matching Algorithm: Employed to find instances of a predefined defect template within tile images.
Contours: Used to outline and highlight detected defects, enabling easy visualization and analysis.
### Features
Template Matching: Locates potential defects by comparing predefined templates with tile images.
Contour Detection: Identifies and outlines areas of interest, making defects more visible.
Python Implementation: All code is written in Python, making it easy to understand and modify.
### Usage
To use this system:

Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/tiles-defect-detection.git
Install Dependencies: Ensure you have OpenCV installed (pip install opencv-python)
